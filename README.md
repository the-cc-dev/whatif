# whatif

whatif discovers dependencies that need to be updated after updating a package.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install -g whatif
```

## Quick start

From time to time, if you update a package, you also need to update any dependant packages, and any dependant packages of the dependant packages, andâ€¦ it's turtles all the way down.

To simplify this task you can run whatif within the directory that contains all of your repositories. Provide the name of an updated package as a parameter:

```bash
$ whatif <package>
```

As a result `reqd` will give you a list of all packages where the given package is either referenced as a `dependency` or as a `devDependency` in the appropriate `package.json` file.

Please note that if you use tab completion, the package name may have a trailing slash accidentally. whatif will remove it automatically, so it's perfectly fine to run

```bash
$ whatif lodash/
```

instead of the following command.

```bash
$ whatif lodash
```

## Running the build

To build this module use [roboter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/roboter).

```
